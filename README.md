CS50 Week 1
My scratch project is a simple game where the player controls a footballer using arrow keys.
The aim is to get the ball into the goal without it touching the goal keeper. 
When the player scores, the crowd cheers and their points are tallied
When the keeper touches the ball but the crowd gasps and their points are tallied. 
After each point is recorded the player and the ball's positions are reset. 
There is a reset button to clear the score and reset the positions of the ball and the footballer.

Currently the ball only moves in a straight line. Given more time and understanding of the turn function I think it'd be better if the ball moved omnidirectionally, given that the player can move in any direction also.
